This folder has all the music for the game! This README file will have some context for how some of our songs or their names came to be!

**Timeless Lawn**: When I was first introduced to BYTEBOUND and Ultrabox as a whole, this was the first song I made, while Othneil was over the phone guiding me through it. I started with the base (first 4 measures, first 2 insturaments) and in my head, I wanted the song to have a beat drop, and transition into a sort of disco theme. I didn't get exactly what I'd hoped for, but in the end, we got something arguably better. (Also, the name comes from the fact that midway through making the song, I had to mow our lawn, which was a task that would take "forever", which is synonymous with timeless! I thus made the name off of that.) 

**Timeless Lawn (Remaster)**: When I tried to create Everlasting Field by using lawn.wav (seen in commit 5511a78) I tried to supress the peak levels but I couldn't ;-; using variations of the vital 3 insturaments in the original, I started to let loose and created a full "remaster" for the song, giving birth to this! - Kosy
